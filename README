This is the Java API for the Light Weight Event System.

***
Prerequisites
- JDK 1.6.x (http://java.sun.com/)
- Maven 2.2.x (http://apache.maven.org/)

***
How to build
% mvn clean package

***
To increase the read buffer size on the multicast socket, set the system property
MulticastReceiveBufferSize. For example,

java -DMulticastReceiveBufferSize=8388608 ...

***
0.2.1 -> 0.2.2 Changes
- If the size of the event is too large an EventSizeException will be thrown
instead of an EventSystemException.
- Fixed a bug with the MulticastEventEmitter where it was closing the socket
before calling super.shutdown which was trying to send a System::Shutdown message.
- Added the ability to set a maximum capacity on the internal queue used by the
ThreadedProcessor. If you set the queue size, you can avoid out of memory exceptions,
but you run the risk of dropping events on the floor (it would depend on how fast
you are processing events and how big your network buffer is).

***
0.1.1 -> 0.2.0 Changes
- I removed the files that are autogenerated by javacc and made it part of the build.
The .java files will end up in target/generated-sources/javacc if you are interested in
seeing them.

- I also nuked the ant build.xml file. I don't want to support both ant and maven and imo,
maven wins. :)

- Added more unit tests

- Allow post event creation validation

- Use LinkedBlockingQueues where possible to retain event order and help synchronization.

- I removed AttributeNotSetException because throwing an exception if an attribute isn't set
in the event should not be the proper behavior (after all, HashMap and the like do not do this).
