This is the Java API for the Light Weight Event System.

***
Prerequisites
- JDK 1.5.x (http://java.sun.com/) or later
- Maven 3.0.4 (http://apache.maven.org/) or later
- GPG, if you are going to deploy a release (http://www.gnupg.org/download)

***
How to build:
% mvn clean package

To create a release:
% mvn release:prepare release:perform

NOTE: you cannot use batch-mode anymore. Deploying to central requires a gpg key
and it needs to prompt you for your passphrase. It will error out if you have
specified batch-mode.

NOTE: Read this document for deploying releases to central:
https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide

If the release plugin doesn't work for some reason and you need to push to central,
you will need to check out the release tag and then do the manual deploy:
% git clone git@github.com:lwes/lwes-java.git
% cd lwes-java && git checkout -b lwes-java-1.1.2 lwes-java-1.1.2 # Or whatever the tag name is
% mvn package gpg:sign deploy

***
To increase the read buffer size on the multicast socket, set the system property
MulticastReceiveBufferSize. For example,

java -DMulticastReceiveBufferSize=8388608 ...
